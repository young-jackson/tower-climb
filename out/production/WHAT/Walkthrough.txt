Beating the game requires some luck, but ultimately it should be a pretty
easy task. The most important things to remember is that the buff-items
in this game are overtuned, so make sure to exploit them. And also prioritize
luck buffs always. It is recommended to fight as many monsters on the
floor as possible as that yields more money. Preferably save money for the
Kossu that you can get on the 4th floor for 1000G, since it is by far the best
item in the game. In any case, you can follow the following list (obtained with
Shop.Tiers() in REPL), which shows the stat to money ratio of each item, so that
you can optimize your money usage:

Note that it is also important to keep your power level and greed in check,
as these stats cause more difficult enemies to spawn. Just for a heads-up, the
threshhold for power level and greed at each floor transition goes as follows:
F1 -> F2 => 200 | 200
F2 -> F3 => 500 | 300
F3 -> F4 => 800 | 400
It may also not be possible to avoid them altogether, but it can be avoided in
certain situations by unequipping/selling your equipment. This game has not had
enough time to go through proper playtesting, so if you ever get stuck, feel free
to use the dev commands. Try "/dev".


(There may be a secret boss on the final floor...)
