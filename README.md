# tower-climb
Tower Climb encapsulates my first experience in coding a game of any kind. This in particular is a text-based one, 
where the character is controlled via short commands in the console. The game itself is a rogue-like dungeon crawler
adventure, where the player progresses mainly by engaging in combat with many different monsters. For a more detailed
description, type 'help' in the console after running the game. For further help in completing the game, refer to the
walkthrough file in the same project. The picture file "Huijarin Kartta" pictures the overall map of the game.

The code is runnable in scala 2.13.0, and requires a JDK of version 11.
